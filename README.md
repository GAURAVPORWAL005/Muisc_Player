# Muisc_Player
I developed this Music Player using Java language. It fetches songs from the SD card and play them. It is a fully functional Music Player app which has various advanced options like Shuffle play ,Loop, Sorting of songs on the basis of date and size , Search bar etc. It also has Notification services and you can also control the songs from Mini player.
